"""Inflation module for ``fecon236``

- "Unified" inflation is a sythesis of CPI, CPIc, PCE, PCEc.
- For derivation of ``foreinfl`` see fecon235/nb/fred-inflation.ipynb,
  which is rendered as https://git.io/infl

Notes
-----
For LATEST version, see https://git.io/fecon236

Change Log
----------

* 2018-06-17  Spin-off ``foreinfl`` from ``top.py``.
