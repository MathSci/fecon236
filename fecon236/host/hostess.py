Circular Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By putting imports within a function we used a technique called
"DEFERRED IMPORTING." This does not violate Python syntax, as the
official documentation states:

    "It is customary but not required to place all import statements
    at the beginning of a module (or script, for that matter)."
    https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/modules.html

The downside to deferred imports generally is readability: one
cannot look at the very top of a module and see all its dependencies.

The official documentation also says that it is advisable to use
"import X.Y", instead of other statements such as
"from X import Y", or in the worst case: "from X.Y import *".

As for circular imports, the candidate solutions are explained at
https://stackoverflow.com/a/37126790 by brendan-abel
which can be BEST summarized as: use absolute (not relative) imports,
and definitely AVOID the "from" import style.

The downside to absolute import style is that the names can
get super long. But one can create aliases using "=" with Python objects,
especially functions, at the cost of readability. Generally this solution
across the tops of many modules becomes very tiresome to implement.

"Deferred importing" can speed up startup time, so it is not bad practice,
but some claim that it is a sign of bad design. The notion that circular
dependencies are somehow an indication of poor design seems to be more a
reflection on Python as a language ("glaring bug in the import machinery")
rather than a legitimate design point.

Example of fecon236 circular dependency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the fred module, ``holtwinters.ema`` is called to smooth data.
In the holtwinters module, ``hostess.get`` is called to retrieve data.
But the hostess module relies on ``fred.getfred`` in the fred module.

Our deferred import hack in this module, allows us to freely use the
``from`` syntax everywhere else: e.g. ``from fecon236.host.hostess import get``
at the top of modules without ``ImportError`` or ``AttributeError`` in both
python27 and python3.



Change Log
----------

* 2018-06-18  Circular dependency HACK [Endnotes]: put imports inside get()
  and avoid "from" import syntax there. Fix #3
* 2018-06-15  Faster get() by exploiting startswith('s4'). Pass flake8.
  Raised error messaging improved for getstock().
* 2018-06-14  Spin-off get() from top.py.
* 2018-03-12  fecon235.py, fecon235 v5.18.0312, https://git.io/fecon235

def get(code, maxi=0):
    """Unifies getfred, getqdl, and getstock for data retrieval.


    Futures slang is of the form 'f4spotyym' where

    * spot is the spot symbol in lower case,
    * yy   is the last two digits of the year
    * m    is the delivery month code,

    so for December 2015 COMEX Gold: 'f4xau15z'

    Stock slang can be also used for ETFs and mutual funds.
    The general form is 's4symbol' where the symbol must be in
    lower case, so for SPY, use 's4spy' as an argument.

    ``get`` will accept the vendor code directly as string, e.g.
    from FRED and Quandl, or use one of our abbreviated variables
    documented in the appropriate module listed in the import section.
    The notebooks provide good code examples in action.

    Parameters
    ----------
    code: str
        fredcode, quandlcode, futures slang, or stock slang
    maxi: int
        Set maximum number of data points, where 0 implies the default value.
