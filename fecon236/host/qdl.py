"""Access Quandl data vendors using fecon236.

We define functions to access data from Quandl.  Each time-series and its
frequency has its own "quandlcode" available at: https://www.quandl.com

Single column dot notation for quandlcode: e.g. 'NSE/OIL.4'
grabs the 4th column of NSE/OIL.

Favorite quandlcodes are variables named d4*, m4*, q4*
which indicate their frequency: daily, monthly, or quarterly.

On 2016-04-22 Quandl released version 3 of their API which was a "drop-in"
replacement of version 2, but a very complex *package* which has not seen
any substantive improvement since that date -- see
https://github.com/quandl/quandl-python/blob/master/2_SERIES_UPGRADE.md

Their version 2.8.7, however, had the virtue of being just a *single* module,
and has been battle-tested in fecon235 notebooks since 2015-08-03.
That module has been forked at fecon236 and renamed ``_ex_Quandl.py``.
This qdl module is a wrapper around ``_ex_Quandl.py``, and
as of 2018-05-22 has passed `tests/test_qdl.py`.


API Key
-------

You will need an API Key UNLESS you are doing fewer than 50 calls per day.
After creating an account at quandl.com, set your authentication token
by executing this fecon236 function (described in this module):

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-group: Ignore

    import fecon236 as fe

    fe.qdl.setQuandlToken(API_key)

The token will then be stored in your working directory for continued use.
Authtokens are saved as pickled files in the local directory as "authtoken.p"
so it is unnecessary to enter them more than once, unless you change your
working directory.


Usage Rules
-----------

API usage is free for registered users. Registered users have a limit of 2,000
calls per 10 minutes, and a limit of 50,000 calls per day. Premium data
subscribers have a limit of 5,000 calls per 10 minutes, and a limit of 720,000
calls per day.  Dataset calls are rate-limited to 2,000 calls per 10 minutes.

All API requests must be made using HTTPS. Requests made over HTTP will fail.


Quandl Codes
------------

To use the API to download a dataset, you will need to know the dataset's
"quandlcode".  Each dataset on Quandl has a unique Quandl code, comprising a
database_code and a dataset_code. For instance, the dataset for Bitcoin
prices has the Quandl code 'BCHAIN/MKPRU', where BCHAIN is the database_code
and MKPRU is the dataset_code.

Dataset codes are not guaranteed to be unique across databases. SHFE/CUG2014
is not the same as MCX/CUG2014. You need both the database_code and the
dataset_code to fully identify a dataset.


Pre-calculations
----------------

In general, we suggest downloading the data in raw format in the highest
frequency possible and preforming any data manipulation in pandas itself.

Quandl allows you to perform certain elementary calculations on your data
prior to downloading. The transformations currently availabe are row-on-row
change, percentage change, cumulative sum, and normalize (set starting value
at 100).  If a datapoint for time t is denoted as y[t] and the transformed
data as y'[t], the available transformations are defined as below.

+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
| Transformation      | Parameter     | Effect                            |
+=====================+===============+===================================+
| Row-on-row change   | ``diff``      | y'[t] = y[t] - y[t-1]             |
+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
| Row-on-row % change | ``rdiff``     | y'[t] = (y[t] - y[t-1])/y[t-1]    |
+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
| Cumulative sum      | ``cumul``     | y'[t] = y[t] +y[t-1] + ... + y[0] |
+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+
| Start at 100        | ``normalize`` | y'[t] = (y[t]/y[0]) * 100         |
+---------------------+---------------+-----------------------------------+

Note that y[0] in the above table refers to the starting date for the API
call, i.e., the date specified by trim_start= or rows=, NOT the starting date
of the entire dataset.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-add-ignore: F821

    df = getqdl(quandlcode)

Low-level API
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A `fecon236` user would normally just employ high-level wrapper getqdl(),
not _qget(), but for the developer the following may be interesting:

The module named as quandlapi is able to return data in 2 formats: a pandas
data series ("pandas") and a numpy array ("numpy"). "pandas" is the default.
One can specify the format explicitly:

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-add-ignore: F821

    mydata = fe.qdl._qget("WIKI/AAPL", returns="numpy")

You can get multiple datasets in one call by passing an array of Quandl codes:

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-add-ignore: F821

    mydata = fe.qdl._qget(["NSE/OIL.4", "WIKI/AAPL.1"])

This grabs the 4th column of dataset NSE/OIL and the 1st column of dataset
WIKI/AAPL, and returns them in a single call.

We can manipulate or transform the data prior to download [not advised]:

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-add-ignore: F821

    #  Specific Date Range:
    mydata = fe.qdl._qget("NSE/OIL", trim_start="yyyy-mm-dd",
                          trim_end="yyyy-mm-dd")

    #  Frequency Change:
    #  Choices are ("daily"|weekly"|"monthly"|"quarterly"|"annual")
    mydata = fe.qdl._qget("NSE/OIL", collapse="annual")

    #  Transformations:
    #  Choices are ("diff"|"rdiff"|"normalize"|"cumul")
    mydata = fe.qdl._qget("NSE/OIL", transformation="rdiff")

    #  Return last n rows:
    mydata = fe.qdl._qget("NSE/OIL", rows=5)

A request with a full list of options would look like the following:

.. code-block:: python
    :flake8-add-ignore: F821

    data = fe.qdl._qget('PRAGUESE/PX', authtoken='xxxxxx',
                        trim_start='2001-01-01',
                        trim_end='2010-01-01', collapse='annual',
                        transformation='rdiff', rows=4, returns='numpy')

#  instance, the front month contract has depth 1, the second month contract

    Notes
    -----

    * ``maxi`` is just arbitrarily large as default, useful to limit data to
      last maxi rows, e.g. maxi=1 for most recent row only, but NOT used in all
      cases below.
    * We can SYNTHESIZE a quandlcode by use of string equivalent arg.
