"""Bootstrap module for fecon236

- Efficient storage and rescaling of empirical data.
    - Normalize, but retain features of the empirical distribution.
- Design bootstrap to study alternate histories.
    - Visualize sample price paths.
    - Bootstrap for small-sample statistics.
    - Bootstrap for determining probabilities of events.
- Specify hybrid population array using synthetic rates of return
  from GM(2) Gaussian Mixture model.


Usage
-----
Two methods to efficiently pre-compute asset returns:

    - ``writefile_normdiflog``: Create a CSV file of normalized rates of
      return.
    - Use CSV file in ``csv2ret`` to create "population" array of returns.

- Repeatedly bootstrap from population array, poparr, in computer memory
  to simulate price histories by ``bsret2prices``.
- See [TO BE ANNOUNCED] notebook in fecon235 for concrete usage and studies.


If the data is temporally correlated, bootstrapping will destroy the
inherent correlations. Our broad practical justification
in favor of bootstrapping here is that for short-term financial
time-series, most frequently, the best in-sample fit of an
ARIMA model to log(price) is AR(1) with unit root.
This implies that the underlying stochastic process is memoryless.
To add further credence, studies of post-sample performances
regularly show that it is extremely difficult to surpass the
most current price as the best forecast of prices over long
future horizons among all competing models.

Change Log
----------

* 2018-07-07  Add ``smallsample_gmr`` to demo geometric mean rates.
  Add ``smallsample_loss`` to demo probability of loss.
* 2018-07-05  Let ``replace=True`` as default argument.
  The opposite was useful during testing.
* 2018-07-04  Add ``hybrid2ret`` for synthesis with Gaussian mixture.
* 2018-07-01  Apply the functions extracted to sim module.
* 2018-06-28  TOTAL REWRITE: generalization and clarification of logic flow.
  Deprecate fecon235/nb/SIMU-mn0-sd1pc-d4spx_1957-2014.csv.gz
  Include recipe for creating similar CSV files.
* 2018-06-08  Spin-off 2014 material from ``sim.py``, but needs generalization.
  Let N generally be the count:= sample size.
