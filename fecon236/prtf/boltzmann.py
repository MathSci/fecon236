"""Boltzmann portfolio for fecon236

Alternative to Markowitz portfolio. Usage demonstrated in notebook, see
fecon235/nb/prtf-boltzmann-1.ipynb for explicit details and derivation,
or Part 1: https://git.io/boltz1 and Part 2: https://git.io/boltz2

One virtually has no control over how the assets perform and interact. Only
the portfolio allocation over time is in our decision set. Let's recast the
underlying assets as agents which supposedly will help increase our wealth.
Our task will be to select the expert(s) among the agents and to allocate
portions of our current wealth.

To discriminate among the agents we need their performance metrics. Since our
objective is to maximize future wealth, the optimal metric is the geometric
mean rate of each agent. From our research we know how to include risks,
including leptokurtotic events ("fat tails"), into that single metric.

There is evidence that the performance of some agents are inter-correlated.
Therefore, rather than select a single expert, we choose to diversify our bets
among a few agents, and call that our "portfolio." To maximize the geometric
mean rate of the portfolio, the second order condition is to minimize its
variance. That problem is easily solved by borrowing the weights of what is
known as the "Markowitz global minimum variance portfolio."

Those weights depend on the covariance structure of the agents' performance
which is unfortunately not stable over time. There may be some information
which can be exploited to tilt our bets favorably.

The Markowitz weights may suggest that we bet against the consistently poor
performance of some agents. We shall generally regard the weights as
advisory, taking what suits us and renormalizing.

To summarize the information set so far, we cast the agents in a game, each
with some score. When the game consists of multiple rounds, we can use tools
from reinforcement learning to help us make the best sequential decisions.

The ``softmax`` function is fed the scores to compute the probability of a
particular agent being the expert. This function takes temperature as a
diffusion parameter, that is, an optimal way to diversify our bets across
possible experts. The theory here is due to Ludwig Boltzmann and his work
on statistical mechanics and entropy. But the temperature setting can also be
seen as a Bayesian way to express the overall uncertainty involved with
estimating the various measures.

Finally, those probabilities are combined with our renormalized weights to
arrive at "pweights," our portfolio weights.

Notes
-----
* The ``softmax`` function is in ``fecon236/ml/learn.py`` since it applies
  more widely in machine learning.
